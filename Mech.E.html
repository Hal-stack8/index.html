    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">

    <p style="color: #ffffff"> Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering is a broad four to five-year undergraduate degree program designed to develop tomorrow's engineers, problem solvers, and innovators. As one of the world's oldest and most diverse fields of engineering, mechanical engineering lies at the heart of modern technology and industry.

It provides students with a solid foundation in foundation fields of thermodynamics, mechanics, materials science, fluid dynamics, machine design, and manufacturing processes. Through a solid blend of theory and application, students are taught to design, analyze, and maintain mechanical systems that power industries ranging from automobiles and airplanes to energy, healthcare, and robots.

Students are taught to apply advanced engineering technology like computer-aided design (CAD), simulation, and automation systems and exposed to emerging technologies in areas of sustainable energy, mechatronics, and additive manufacturing (3D printing).

The course program centers on problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication—skills that are essential to a career in engineering. The students also get industry attachments, laboratory work, capstone design projects, and research work, which ensure that they graduate with not just knowledge, but also practical skills.

BSc. in Mechanical Engineering graduates are well poised to pursue a broad spectrum of career opportunities in product development, mechanical design, systems engineering, manufacturing, consulting, and project management. The course also provides a good platform for postgraduate studies in engineering, innovation, or applied sciences.

Wherever they initiate change, from driving technological advancement to constructing infrastructure and creating sustainable engineering solutions, mechanical engineers are leading the way into the future—and it all begins here.</p>
