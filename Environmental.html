  </section>

    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">
    <p style="color: #ffffff"> Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering is a forward-looking four to five-year undergraduate program that prepares students to solve some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. By integrating principles from civil engineering, chemistry, biology, and environmental science, this degree equips students with the knowledge and tools needed to protect human health and preserve the environment for future generations.

The program covers core areas such as water and wastewater treatment, air quality management, solid and hazardous waste management, environmental impact assessment, environmental chemistry, and sustainable design. Students are trained to engineer systems and technologies that reduce pollution, restore ecosystems, and promote the sustainable use of natural resources.

Through a blend of classroom instruction, laboratory experiments, fieldwork, and industry collaboration, students learn how to analyze environmental systems, design solutions, and apply regulatory frameworks. Skills in modeling, geographic information systems (GIS), environmental data analysis, and risk assessment are emphasized throughout the course.

BSc. in Environmental Engineering graduates are in high demand across sectors including government agencies, environmental consultancies, non-governmental organizations, water utilities, energy firms, and construction and mining industries. They often work in roles related to environmental compliance, sustainability planning, water resources management, pollution control, and climate resilience.

Whether mitigating the effects of climate change, improving public health through clean water access, or designing sustainable cities, environmental engineers are essential in building a greener, more resilient future—and it all begins here.</p>
