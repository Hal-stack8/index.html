  </section>

    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">
    <p style="color: #ffffff"> The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering is a comprehensive four to five-year undergraduate program focused on training students in the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the infrastructure that sustains modern civilization. As one of the oldest and most essential branches of engineering, civil engineering is responsible for the systems that allow societies to function—ranging from roads, bridges, railways, airports, and seaports to water supply networks, drainage systems, dams, buildings, and environmental protection structures. Students pursuing this degree are equipped with a robust foundation in mathematics, physics, materials science, fluid mechanics, geotechnical analysis, structural design, and environmental engineering. The program also emphasizes sustainable development, risk management, and the integration of technology such as CAD, GIS, and Building Information Modeling (BIM). Throughout the course, students learn how to balance safety, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and aesthetic value, while adhering to ethical standards and regulatory frameworks. Subfields such as structural engineering, transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resources engineering, and environmental engineering allow for specialization, enabling graduates to address diverse challenges—from building climate-resilient cities to designing earthquake-proof buildings or managing urban transportation logistics. Civil engineers play a crucial role in both urban and rural development, disaster risk reduction, and the delivery of public services, making them vital contributors to national and global progress. The program integrates hands-on projects, industrial attachment, laboratory work, and capstone design courses, ensuring that graduates not only possess theoretical knowledge but also practical skills and real-world exposure. Upon completion, graduates are prepared to work in both the public and private sectors, taking on roles in consulting, construction, project management, research, and policy-making, or continuing with postgraduate studies in specialized areas. In an ever-changing world facing rapid urbanization, climate challenges, and infrastructure deficits, civil engineering remains a field of enduring relevance, innovation, and profound societal impact.</p>
