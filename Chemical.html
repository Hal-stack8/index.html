  </section>

    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">
    <p style="color: #ffffff"> Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering is a dynamic four to five-year undergraduate program designed to train highly skilled engineers who can transform raw materials into valuable products through sustainable, safe, and efficient processes. As a multidisciplinary field that bridges chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics with engineering principles, Chemical Engineering is central to addressing global challenges such as energy, food production, clean water, health, and climate change.

Students are equipped with core knowledge in chemical reaction engineering, thermodynamics, process control, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and separation processes. They also gain exposure to the design and operation of chemical plants and industrial systems that convert materials into everything from fuel, plastics, and pharmaceuticals to food additives and clean water.

This program emphasizes hands-on learning through lab work, pilot plant training, simulation software, and capstone design projects. Students develop competencies in critical thinking, data analysis, process optimization, safety management, and sustainable design. As part of the program, industry attachments and research opportunities give students a real-world perspective and technical edge.

BSc. in Chemical Engineering graduates are well-suited for careers in energy, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing, environmental management, materials science, and biotechnology. They often work in process design, product development, environmental regulation, operations, and technical consulting. The course also provides an excellent pathway for postgraduate study in chemical, environmental, biomedical, or materials engineering.

Whether it’s designing renewable energy systems, developing new materials, creating cleaner manufacturing processes, or ensuring food and drug safety, chemical engineers shape the world at a molecular level—and it all starts here.</p>
