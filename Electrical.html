    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">
    <p style="color: #ffffff"> The Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering is a dynamic four to five-year undergraduate program that prepares students to be world-class innovators, engineers, and leaders of the world's most revolutionary sector today. Being the foundation of contemporary civilization, electrical and electronics engineering drives technological innovation in the energy systems, communications, automation, and electronics industries. This course provides students with a broad foundation in core subjects such as circuit theory, electromagnetics, electronics, digital systems, signal processing, electrical machines, control systems, power systems, and embedded systems. Students also gain insight into how to combine theory and practice through lab exposure to simulation and modeling software, microcontroller programming, and circuit design at the lab scale.

The programme is structured to give comprehensive knowledge in both low-voltage electronics and high-voltage electrical systems so that the students are well-positioned to design, build, and maintain smart systems, communication networks, and green power infrastructure. With high emphasis on innovation, sustainability, and problem-solving, the curriculum gives impetus to research new fronts such as renewable energy, smart grids, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence-based engineering applications. With laboratory instruction, industry practice, research, and senior design experience, graduates are not only skilled engineers, but also versatile thinkers capable of solving 21st-century engineering challenges.

BSc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduates are ready to find employment in power generation and transmission, telecommunication, automation, aerospace, electronics manufacturing, biomedical equipment, and systems engineering. The curriculum also provides a solid foundation for further specialization at the graduate level in fields such as embedded systems, nanotechnology, control engineering, and energy policy. In a world increasingly reliant on connectivity and electrification, electrical and electronics engineers are constructing the future—and theirs starts here.</p>
