    <section id="program-overview" style="padding: 2rem; text-align: initial;">
    <p style="color: #ffffff"> The Bachelor of Science in Mechatronics Engineering is a forward-looking four to five-year undergraduate program that merges mechanical, electrical, electronics, computer, and control engineering into one integrated discipline—designed for students eager to build the intelligent systems and smart machines of tomorrow.

Mechatronics lies at the core of automation and robotics, enabling the creation of innovative solutions like self-driving vehicles, robotic arms, drones, intelligent manufacturing systems, and smart consumer devices. Students are introduced to foundational subjects such as mechanics, electronics, control theory, microcontrollers, sensors, and embedded systems, while developing programming skills and proficiency in system integration.

The course emphasizes both theory and practice, offering hands-on experience with tools like PLCs, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, CAD/CAM software, MATLAB, and robotics kits. Through practical labs, design projects, and internships, students are trained to conceptualize, design, and build smart electro-mechanical systems that can sense, decide, and act.

Mechatronics engineers are multi-skilled problem solvers who thrive at the intersection of disciplines. Graduates are equipped for careers in industrial automation, robotics, automotive systems, medical technology, aerospace, and smart infrastructure. They can work as automation engineers, robotics specialists, systems designers, or pursue further studies and research in cutting-edge technologies like AI integration, bionics, and IoT systems.

With a focus on innovation, adaptability, and real-world impact, this degree positions graduates at the forefront of the technological revolution—where machines become intelligent, and engineering meets the future.</p>
